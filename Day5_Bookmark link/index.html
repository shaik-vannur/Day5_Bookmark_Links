    <h1>Penalty imposition on unmasked people using deep learning</h1>
    <h2 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
      COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worldwide loss of lives of many people.
      This disease transmission happens mainly through the water or any sort of
      droplets transmission from nose, mouth of one person to other. Masking
      one’s self & preventing is the only way to escape from this
      life-threatening disease. This model processes the images of various
      qualities and dimensions. CNN, open CV, Tensor Flow is used to detect the
      mask on the face of the person. Super resolution is performed, in order to
      enhance the quality of the images from low to high. Database is maintained
      to match and compare the faces of the images captured. When a person’s
      image is captured and identified without mask, it leads to penalty
      imposition. Then warning is sent to the person’s mobile and mail address
      signifying that mask is not available. Even if the person’s nose and mouth
      are not completely covered, a message is issued, stating a warning to the
      specific individual. If the person is identified without mask more than
      once, then penalty is imposed based on the number of the person. A web
      page is deployed to search the status of the penalty of the certain
      individual.

    <h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      In December 2019, a contagious disease named COVID-19(China Originated
      Virus in December - 2019) has been rise across the world and was declared
      as a pandemic, which caused the death of millions of people. Scientists
      across the world have struggled a lot and tried to find out the ways and
      solutions to avoid the pandemic. There by, they have found out that water
      droplets through their mouth and nose are the main mode of the
      transmission of the virus. Scientists then stated that mask usage is the
      major mode of preventing the spread f the virus. Therefore many humans
      across the world have adapted themselves with the usage, but still there
      are some kinds of people who were careless and themselves and the
      society.ML is a broad category of computer systems that can learn and
      adapt without human intervention by using algorithms that analyze data,
      discover patterns and draw inferences from those patterns. ML is a subset
      of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is one subset of machine
      learning, while neural networks are a subset of deep learning. The more
      data available to use, the more likely deep learning will give the better
      solution. As the data scales, deep learning becomes much more efficient.
      In a world where available data does nothing but scale week after week and
      year after year, it’s likely the adoption of deep learning will continue
      to escalate and increase enormously. Deep learning algorithms analyze
      input data, find patterns in the data and then predict the output data.
      While it is the algorithm itself that does that, its effectiveness depends
      on both the quality of the data and how the data science team has tuned
      the algorithm's hyper parameters.

      This project deals with the identifying the mask on the face for the
      people, whether the individual or group of people are wearing or not. This
      research can be processed by using multiple types of machine learning
      algorithms. The algorithm is trained by using various kinds of images in
      different perspective and various positions. If any certain individual or
      group of people are not following the mask protocol completely, their
      image is captured and then face recognition of the particular person
      happens. The captured image is then compared with the images which are
      available in the database. Hence, if the data of the individual is
      available in the database, a notification stating that a penalty is being
      imposed against them for not following the COVID-19 protocols is sent to
      the person’s mobile and mail address.

      The main aim of researcher here is to achieve low inference time and high
      accuracy. The concept of transfer learning, along with Resnet50 are
      described in the paper.In this paper, researcher conducted the experiment
      with three different kinds of models. Namely they areResNet50, AlexNet and
      MobileNet. R-CNN is applied at the initial stager and further SVM is
      processed.SPNN a combination of R-CNN with an SPP layer to compute the
      entire image in a single-shot resulted in the increase of speed.
      Transferlearning has become an added advantage here. Cropped ROI, affine
      transformation are used in this paper because there can be faces of
      different sizes and Positions.

      The technique used in this paper are hybrid method of moments and local
      binary patterns histogram (LBPH). LBPH is possible only when the image is
      available in the grayscale format. It is not possible when the image is in
      the RGB format. It is performed for 3 x 3 matrix. Such that when the
      result is greater than zero, the value turns one else it exists as zero.
      Histogram is plotted based on these binary values.Three fidelity criteria
      mean squared error (MSE), Chi-Squared, and peak signal-to-noise ratio
      (PSNR) are used in this paper to measure the information loss. As per the
      researcher, long histograms in LBPH is slowing down the process. To reduce
      this, Symmetric Centre LBP is proposed, through which values are compare
      with the centre value only, where it can reduce the number of the
      comparisons.

    <h2 id="methodology">METHODOLOGY</h2>
    <p>
      Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a artificial neural network that is
      dominant in various computer vision tasks and in different interests. It
      can be automatically select feature through backpropagation by using
      different layers called convolution layers, pooling layers and fully
      connected layers, it is designed to be make the selection. CNN can be
      applied to small datasets and can resolve overfitting. As above mentioned
      it as three types of layers convolution, pooling and fully connected
      layers. The first two, convolution and pooling layers, perform feature
      extraction and the third a fully connected layer maps the extracted
      features into final output named as classification. CNNs are highly
      efficient for image processing, that can a feature may occur anywhere in
      the image. This can be optimized by using optimization algorithm called
      backpropagation and gradient descent. Pooling and convolution operations
      can also be performed in 2D and 3D too. CNN is combined to use the both
      linear and non-linear operations these can also be called as convolution
      and activation operations. It is divided as a feature map as a sum up of
      input. Pooling layer has max pooling operation, which extracts patches
      from feature maps which can be called as downsamples to make discarding
      the all other values for dimensions of feature maps to be remains
      unchanged. Fully connected layer is formally flattened that can be used in
      1D. this layer can also be called as dense layer which is connected to
      every output by their given weights. It is the output layer, once the
      operations were done by convolution and pooling layers, the output is
      mapped by a subset of this layer as the output of the network and every
      class is undergoes classification tasks. After this, the training a
      network is to find the kernels in convolution layers and weights in fully
      connected layer. This is used to differentiate the predictions and truth
      table on training dataset.

    <h2 id="results">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>
    <p>
      Face mask detection is processed with pretrained model of CNN called as
      MobileNetV2 over 5000 images of masked and 5000 images of unmasked
      people.Hence, 20 epochs are proceeded to train the model.The accuracy of
      this model result is about 98.74%. Face recognition is processed with
      Siamese network, there would be no training, as it means the facial
      similarities based on distance between edges of faces.The tests have been
      processed with multiple thresholds ranging from 0.2 to 0.7. But the
      threshold 0.5 has given best results of it.The accuracy here would be 100%
      , when face image is available in the database, else the accuracy is
      85%.Face mask detection is processed with pretrained model of CNN called
